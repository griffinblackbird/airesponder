## Pydantic V1.10 vs. V2

Pydantic V2 is a ground-up rewrite that offers many new features, performance improvements, and some breaking changes compared to Pydantic V1.

If you're using Pydantic V1 you may want to look at the
[pydantic V1.10 Documentation](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) or,
[`1.10.X-fixes` git branch](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/tree/1.10.X-fixes). Pydantic V2 also ships with the latest version of Pydantic V1 built in so that you can incrementally upgrade your code base and projects: `from pydantic import v1 as pydantic_v1`.

## Help

See [documentation](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) for more details.

## Installation

Install using `pip install -U pydantic` or `conda install pydantic -c conda-forge`.
For more installation options to make Pydantic even faster,
see the [Install](https://docs.pydantic.dev/install/) section in the documentation.

## A Simple Example

```python
from datetime import datetime
from typing import Optional
from pydantic import BaseModel

class User(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str = 'John Doe'
    signup_ts: Optional[datetime] = None
    friends: list[int] = []

external_data = {'id': '123', 'signup_ts': '2017-06-01 12:22', 'friends': [1, '2', b'3']}
user = User(**external_data)
print(user)
#> User id=123 name='John Doe' signup_ts=datetime.datetime(2017, 6, 1, 12, 22) friends=[1, 2, 3]
print(user.id)
#> 123
```

## v2.12.4 (2025-11-05)

[GitHub release](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/releases/tag/v2.12.4)

This is the fourth 2.12 patch release, fixing more regressions, and reverting a change in the `build()` method
of the [`AnyUrl` and Dsn types](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/networks/).

This patch release also fixes an issue with the serialization of IP address types, when `serialize_as_any` is used. The next patch release
will try to address the remaining issues with *serialize as any* behavior by introducing a new *polymorphic serialization* feature, that
should be used in most cases in place of *serialize as any*.

* Fix issue with forward references in parent `TypedDict` classes by [@Viicos](https://github.com/Viicos) in [#12427](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/12427).

    This issue is only relevant on Python 3.14 and greater.
* Exclude fields with `exclude_if` from JSON Schema required fields by [@Viicos](https://github.com/Viicos) in [#12430](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/12430)
* Revert URL percent-encoding of credentials in the `build()` method
  of the [`AnyUrl` and Dsn types](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/networks/) by [@davidhewitt](https://github.com/davidhewitt) in
  [pydantic-core#1833](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core/pull/1833).

    This was initially considered as a bugfix, but caused regressions and as such was fully reverted. The next release will include
    an opt-in option to percent-encode components of the URL.
* Add type inference for IP address types by [@davidhewitt](https://github.com/davidhewitt) in [pydantic-core#1868](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core/pull/1868).

    The 2.12 changes to the `serialize_as_any` behavior made it so that IP address types could not properly serialize to JSON.
* Avoid getting default values from defaultdict by [@davidhewitt](https://github.com/davidhewitt) in [pydantic-core#1853](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core/pull/1853).

    This fixes a subtle regression in the validation behavior of the [`collections.defaultdict`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict)
    type.
* Fix issue with field serializers on nested typed dictionaries by [@davidhewitt](https://github.com/davidhewitt) in [pydantic-core#1879](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core/pull/1879).
* Add more `pydantic-core` builds for the three-threaded version of Python 3.14 by [@davidhewitt](https://github.com/davidhewitt) in [pydantic-core#1864](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core/pull/1864).

## v2.12.3 (2025-10-17)

[GitHub release](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/releases/tag/v2.12.3)

### What's Changed

This is the third 2.12 patch release, fixing issues related to the `FieldInfo` class, and reverting a change to the supported
[*after* model validator](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/validators/#model-validators) function signatures.

* Raise a warning when an invalid after model validator function signature is raised by [@Viicos](https://github.com/Viicos) in [#12414](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/12414).
  Starting in 2.12.0, using class methods for *after* model validators raised an error, but the error wasn't raised concistently. We decided
  to emit a deprecation warning instead.
* Add [`FieldInfo.asdict()`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/fields/#pydantic.fields.FieldInfo.asdict) method, improve documentation around `FieldInfo` by [@Viicos](https://github.com/Viicos) in [#12411](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/12411).
  This also add back support for mutations on `FieldInfo` classes, that are reused as `Annotated` metadata. **However**, note that this is still
  *not* a supported pattern. Instead, please refer to the [added example](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/examples/dynamic_models/) in the documentation.

The [blog post](https://pydantic.dev/articles/pydantic-v2-12-release#changes) section on changes was also updated to document the changes related to `serialize_as_any`.

## v2.12.2 (2025-10-14)

[GitHub release](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/releases/tag/v2.12.2)

### What's Changed

#### Fixes

* Release a new `pydantic-core` version, as a corrupted CPython 3.10 `manylinux2014_aarch64` wheel got uploaded ([pydantic-core#1843](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core/pull/1843)).
* Fix issue with recursive generic models with a parent model class by [@Viicos](https://github.com/Viicos) in [#12398](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/12398)

## v2.12.1 (2025-10-13)

[GitHub release](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/releases/tag/v2.12.1)

### What's Changed

This is the first 2.12 patch release, addressing most (but not all yet) regressions from the initial 2.12.0 release.

#### Fixes

* Do not evaluate annotations when inspecting validators and serializers by [@Viicos](https://github.com/Viicos) in [#12355](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/12355)
* Make sure `None` is converted as `NoneType` in Python 3.14 by [@Viicos](https://github.com/Viicos) in [#12370](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/12370)
* Backport V1 runtime warning when using Python 3.14 by [@Viicos](https://github.com/Viicos) in [#12367](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/12367)
* Fix error message for invalid validator signatures by [@Viicos](https://github.com/Viicos) in [#12366](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/12366)
* Populate field name in `ValidationInfo` for validation of default value by [@Viicos](https://github.com/Viicos) in [pydantic-core#1826](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core/pull/1826)
* Encode credentials in `MultiHostUrl` builder by [@willswire](https://github.com/willswire) in [pydantic-core#1829](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core/pull/1829)
* Respect field serializers when using `serialize_as_any` serialization flag by [@davidhewitt](https://github.com/davidhewitt) in [pydantic-core#1829](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core/pull/1829)
* Fix various `RootModel` serialization issues by [@davidhewitt](https://github.com/davidhewitt) in [pydantic-core#1836](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core/pull/1836)

### New Contributors

## v2.12.0 (2025-10-07)

[GitHub release](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/releases/tag/v2.12.0)

### What's Changed

This is the final 2.12 release. It features the work of 20 external contributors and provides useful new features, along with initial Python 3.14 support.
Several minor changes (considered non-breaking changes according to our [versioning policy](https://docs.pydantic.dev/2.12/version-policy/#pydantic-v2))
are also included in this release. Make sure to look into them before upgrading.

**Note that Pydantic V1 is not compatible with Python 3.14 and greater**.
